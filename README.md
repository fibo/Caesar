# Caesar

_Caesar_ is a desktop app that uses the [age file encryption format](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) to encrypt/decrypt files.

Download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/fibo/Caesar/releases).

_Caesar_ app __never connects to the Internet__ by design. Automatic updates are not implemented.

It has no dependency other than [typage](https://github.com/FiloSottile/typage)
which is an official TypeScript implementation of _age file encryption format_.

If your OS or architecture is not included in the _releases page_ it is easy to build _Caesar_, basically by running `npm run make`: see instructions in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

[Gaius Iulius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar) in 58 B.C. used one of the oldest encryption techniques of which we have records: the Caesar cipher.

The _Caesar_ app name should be pronounced as `[ˈkɐ̯ɛ̯.säːr]` with a hard "K" sound at the beginning and the "ae" diphthong pronounced like the English word "eye",  as in Classical Latin _restituta_ pronunciation.
