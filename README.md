# Ceasar

_Caesar_ is a cross-platform desktop app that uses the
[age file encryption format](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) to encrypt/decrypt files.

It has no dependency other than [typage](https://github.com/FiloSottile/typage)
which is an official TypeScript implementation of _age file encryption format_.

It __never connects to the Internet__ by design,
automatic updates are not implemented.

[Gaius Iulius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar) on the 58 B.C. used one of the oldest encryption techniques of which we have records: the Caesar cipher.

The _Caesar_ app name should be pronounced as `[ˈkɐ̯ɛ̯.säːr]` with a hard "K" sound at the beginning and the "ae" diphthong pronounced like the English word "eye",  as in Classical Latin _restituta_ pronunciation.
